In March 2024, I attended the “ALI 6920 (Academic Research)” sessions online through IUP (ALI). The sessions were held on 3/1, 3/8, and 3/15.

The biggest takeaway was learning the fundamentals of academic writing: structure, evidence, and proper citation practices.

Even in short sessions, my approach to forming research questions and building arguments improved.

I plan to carry these skills into future research and writing, focusing on clarity and evidence-based structure.
