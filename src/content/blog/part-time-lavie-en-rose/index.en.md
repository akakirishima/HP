My part-time work at Lavie en Rose (a parfait bar in Miyazaki) taught me the fundamentals of customer service and teamwork.

To keep quality high during busy hours, I streamlined workflows and clarified communication rules.

This experience showed me how small, consistent improvements directly raise service quality.
