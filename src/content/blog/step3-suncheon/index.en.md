In August 2024, I joined the STEP3 short-term program at Sunchon National University in Korea. Although it was only 8 days, it was intense and highly rewarding.

Participating in English lectures and discussions highlighted my language challenges, but also helped me improve how I organize and communicate ideas.

Connecting with local students gave me a fresh perspective on different learning styles and values. Even a short program can provide meaningful cross-cultural learning.

This experience reminded me to keep a practical, real-world mindset in future study and research.
