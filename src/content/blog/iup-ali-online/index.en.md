From February to March 2024, I participated in the ALI online study abroad program at IUP (Indiana University of Pennsylvania).

Even in a virtual setting, learning in an English environment improved my listening and response skills.

Managing time zones and study conditions was challenging, but the short, focused format made learning efficient.

I realized that online study abroad can still be highly valuable when approached with clear goals.
