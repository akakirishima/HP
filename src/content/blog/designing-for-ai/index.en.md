When you introduce AI features, users tend to overestimate what the system can do. Clarify the boundaries early and provide input examples and constraints to build trust.

To improve reliability, include references or links that explain why the AI produced a result. This makes the output more accountable and transparent.

Finally, design for failure. If the output is vague, offer clear next steps like “refine input,” “summarize,” or “try another angle.”
